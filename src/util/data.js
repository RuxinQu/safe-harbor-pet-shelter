    question: "Do they eat dogs in China?",
    answer:
      "While most people would never eat dogs, sadly, there are some who do, and there are even restaurants that serve dog meat. Every now and then, Habao hears about trucks full of dogs being sent to these restaurants. She does everything she can to contact the drivers and rescue the dogs, bringing them back to the shelter. Of course, this costs money. A large percentage of the shelter's funds are used to save dogs from being sent to the restaurants.",

    question: "What can I do to help the shelter?",
    answer: `Since our shelter is located in China, it may be difficult for individuals living outside of China to volunteer with us on tasks like walking dogs, socializing with cats, and cleaning cages. However, there are still many ways you can support us: \n\n1. Donate money or supplies, which are greatly appreciated. Please contact us before making a donation, as we are currently working to resolve technical issues related to accepting different currencies. \n\n2. Adopt a pet from our shelter. By giving a loving home to a pet in need, you will also free up space in the shelter for other animals. \n\n3.Spread the word about our shelter and the animals in need. Even small actions can make a big difference in the lives of shelter animals.Thank you very much for your support.`,

    question: "ðŸŒŸThings to be aware of when adopting a dog/cat overseas",
    answer: `Adopting a dog or cat from overseas can be a wonderful experience, but there are certain things to consider to ensure a smooth transition for both you and the animal. Here are some important factors to keep in mind: \n\n1. Fees: Adopting a pet from China is different from adopting one from a local shelter. The cost is typically around 3000RMB (equivalent to $500, but this may vary depending on the exchange rate), which includes the health certificate, transportation, adoption fee, and additional fees such as a travel crate. Note that the exact fees may vary depending on your location. \n\n2. Virtual meetup until adoption: Unlike adopting a pet from a local shelter, you can only see the pet through a video call. We love every pet in our shelter and will provide you with information regarding their temperament and whether they are good with kids or other animals. \n\n3. It may take longer than expected: Every pet needs a passenger to register under their tickets to be able to fly on the plane. We have volunteers who offer help to resettle these furry friends in another country. However, there are far fewer volunteers compared to the number of animals available for adoption. Due to the cut off of flights, there is a shortage of volunteers, which means some animals remain in the shelter even after a family has decided to adopt them. Instead of waiting for volunteers, one option is to ask any friends or family coming from China to your area if they are willing to help, so your furry friend can be with you earlier.`,

    question: "Is it complicated to adopt a dog/cat from China?",
    answer:
      "Yes, adopting a pet from China does require some extra work. However, we try to make our furry friends can find their forever homes as smoothly as possible. Here's how it works: \n\n1. Find a pet you love and submit an adoption form. \n2. We'll get in touch with you within a week. \n3. Schedule a chat with us so we can help determine if the pet is a good fit for your family. \n4. If everything looks good, we'll need a volunteer, friend, or family member whose flight is going to your location(the hardest part). \n5. We'll obtain the necessary health certificate within the required timeframe before the flight. \n6. Finally, you'll be ready to meet your new family member! \n\nWe're committed to making the adoption process as seamless as possible, and we're always here to answer any questions you may have. If thereâ€™s any question, contact us through the contact form. Weâ€™ll get back to you as soon as possible.",

    question: "How can I find out if the dog/cat is healthy?",
    answer:
      "We prioritize the health and wellbeing of our animals and ensure they are healthy before they become available for adoption. We provide a comprehensive health certificate with specific testing procedures that may vary based on the destination country. In addition, all of our animals are fully vaccinated and spayed or neutered. If you have any concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.",

You can contact us directly through our contact form on our website or by sending an email to safeharborpetshelter@gmail.com. We aim to respond to all inquiries as quickly as possible, but please note that due to the time zone difference and limited volunteer resources, our response time may be delayed.
